# gorv
Educational RISC-V emulator written in Go (1.13)

The emulator will eventually emulate the RV32I instruction set.
It also includes a primitive disassembler.

This is a work in progress, only a few instructions are emulated so far.
Expect bugs and horrible code (this is my first Go program, so it will
probably look to much like C ;-)).
